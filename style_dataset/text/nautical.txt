Traditionally, coastal interiors have centred around the clich√© of seaside accessories, nautical motifs and distressed woodwork. Today, the best coastal interiors adopt a more contemporary approach. Subtle nods to seaside living work beautifully without overdoing it. Think natural materials, plenty of glass and breezy white draperies that combine to create a spacious coastal haven. The coastal look is relaxed and unassuming and, when done right, works just as well in a city apartment as it does in a beach-front property.

COASTAL STYLING IS ALL ABOUT KEEPING THINGS LIGHT AND BREEZY. SET THE MOOD WITH A PALETTE DRAWN FROM SAND, SHELLS, SEA AND SKY, LAYERING CRISP WHITE ROOMS WITH CREAM, KHAKI AND BARELY-THERE BLUES. IF YOUR SPACE IS LACKING IN NATURAL LIGHT, CONSIDER HANGING A MIRROR OPPOSITE A WINDOW

Warm, relaxing, and positive. Nautical decor (also referred to as coastal or cottage decor) reflects the New England beach house spirit. This interior design style is based on white or sand colored foundation, with blue as the primary accent color.

Material-wise, nautical decor incorporates unfinished wood in its tables or chairs, combined with chic linen upholstery for your lounge seats and sofas. Your options for decorative accents are many: seashells in clear jars, jute ropes, rowing oars, sailboats, navigational maps, and more!
