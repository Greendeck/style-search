Bohemian decor captures the carefree and adventurous spirit of the avant-garde lifestyle. It features creative application of rich patterns and vibrant colors, especially those with red or purple tones. The key is to carefully present a purposefully “messy” look. Layer on textiles (throws, pillows, rugs, tapestry) for a warm ambience.

When furnishing, look for pieces that possess ethnic or nomadic vibes. Moroccan, Southwestern, or tribal-inspired designs are currently trending. Composition-wise, boho chic loves textile, wood, animal hide, and metallic accents.
