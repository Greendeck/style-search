Shabby Chic interior design presents a soft, feminine feel that differentiates this look from other vintage styles. It is a uniquely romantic way of decorating that first originated in the the 1980’s in the United Kingdom. Shabby Chic interior design consists of furnishings that are either chosen for their appearance of age and signs of wear and tear, or where new items are distressed to achieve the appearance of an antique. At the same time, a soft, opulent, yet cottage-style decor, often with an affected feel is emphasized to differentiate it from genuine period decor.
Furniture: Shabby Chic furnishings show signs of wear and distressed, time-worn and painted layers.
Fabrics: Fabrics tend to be cottons and old French linens. Whites and pastels are favorite colors.
Decor: Popular decor items are pillows made of vintage fabrics, vintage linens, chenille bedspreads, vintage chandeliers, and anything with roses on it.

Shabby chic decor emphasizes vintage elements to recreate the antique flea market look. The furniture are characterized by their aged appearance, with distressed wood composition covered in sanded milk paint to show signs of wear and tear.

Decorative accents for shabby chic decor should be soft and opulent, often with an affected feel, in order to bring the overall interior design to a contemporary standard. Generously introduce linen textiles for added style. Though orthodox shabby chic colors are white, ecru and pastel, don’t be afraid to apply some vibrant colors.
