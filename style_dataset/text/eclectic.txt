Eclectic interiors borrow ideas from a range of different periods, styles and trends. Break the rules, have a little fun and inject your personality into your decorating – that’s what the eclectic style is all about. Still, it is important to maintain a sense of balance within your decorating. The very best eclectic interiors are a cohesive blend of old, new, colour, texture and pattern.
ECLECTIC STYLE DOESN’T NECESSARILY MEAN THROWING EVERYTHING YOU LIKE INTO ONE ROOM AND CALLING IT A DAY. PAY ATTENTION TO HOW PIECES RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE ROOM AS A WHOLE. YOU REALLY SHOULD DO THIS WITH ANY STYLE BUT IT BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WHEN YOU HAVE LOTS OF DISPARATE PIECES IN ONE SPACE. YOU CAN’T HAVE LOTS OF ITEMS JUST FIGHTING EACH OTHER FOR ATTENTION – THEY NEED TO WORK TOGETHER, TO HAVE SOME COMMONALITIES, TO ‘SPEAK’ TO EACH OTHER IN SOME WAY. ENSURE THEY DO THIS THROUGH SCALE OR COLOUR OR FINISH FOR THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MIX
