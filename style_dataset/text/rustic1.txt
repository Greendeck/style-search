Rustic interior design creates an eclectic look that emphasizes nature: homespun, timeworn, handcrafted, distressed items, constructed of natural materials or finished in a natural hue.
Furniture: Rustic interior design furniture normally consists of wood, reclaimed lumber, and stone. However, bamboo, rattan, sisal, nubby cotton, wool, paper, glass, clay and various types of metal can also be incorporated to embellish the look. Heirlooms, flea market finds, DIY projects, folk art, collections, found items and vintage pieces coexist well in rustic decor, providing contrasting textures, patterns and colors. Metal-worked furniture is another great option to use with this concept.
Structural: The rustic look features wooden beams and columns as well as hardwood or stone flooring. If you donâ€™t have these elements in your home, it is possible to put up faux beams or columns to achieve the look.
