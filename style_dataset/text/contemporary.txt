The contemporary interior style is current, modern, and constantly evolving. The fluidity of contemporary interior design is particularly exciting – what is considered a contemporary interior now will likely change over the course of the twenty-first century. Today, contemporary interiors feature clean, unadorned spaces. Furniture tends to show exposed legs to create a feeling of space. Metals and glass are popular contemporary materials and intricate details are kept to a minimum. 
CONTEMPORARY DECORATING, AT ITS BEST, IS ALL ABOUT CLEAN-LINED COMFORT. THOSE WHO LOVE THIS STYLE UNDERSTAND THAT A HOME CAN BE BOTH PRACTICAL AND BEAUTIFUL. THAT SAID, CONTEMPORARY SPACES CAN FEEL STARK AND IMPERSONAL IF YOU’RE NOT CAREFUL. BALANCE SQUARE CORNERS AND RIGHT ANGLES WITH CURVED EDGES AND MAXIMISE COSINESS WITH PLUSH TEXTURES, LIKE VELVET & SOFT LINEN. I LIKE TO INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE ANTIQUE OR VINTAGE PIECE OF FURNITURE IN AN OTHERWISE CONTEMPORARY ROOM TO LEND IT A SENSE OF HISTORY AND TIMELESSNESS.

The terms modern interior design and contemporary interior design are often used interchangeably, however there is a difference between the two. Contemporary interior design can only mean trendy looks that are in style at any current moment, while modern interior design refers to the specific geometrical, clean-lined style called modern. The fact that the modern style may also be a part of a current look or trend adds to the confusion between modern and contemporary.

Contemporary interiors are comfortable and welcoming without being cluttered and dark and is a style that is equally appropriate for offices and stores, lofts and homes. A contemporary style home can be a quiet and comfortable retreat. The key identifying feature of a contemporary style interior design is line. Line can be used through the use of bold colour blocks, high ceilings, "square" edged furniture, linear wooden floors, floor mats, bare windows and geometric shapes in wall art and sculpture. The bare space, on walls, between pieces of furniture, and above in upper areas also become just as important as the areas filled with objects. Each piece stands out as individual and unique.

Refers to in style or trendy looks. 
Basic, bare but bold. 
Negative space as important as objects 
Smooth, clean and geometric shapes essential. 
Bespoke and unique furniture.
Smooth, clean, geometric shapes are essential for contemporary style furniture pieces with upholstered furniture usually in black, white, or another neutral tone.These pieces should be simple and uncluttered, without curves or decoration. Sofas, chairs, and Ottomans usually have exposed legs with Beds and chairs usually having no trims or tassels. In conclusion, with contemporary interiors, less is more. Go basic, bare, bold, and structural with bespoke, unique and individual furniture.
